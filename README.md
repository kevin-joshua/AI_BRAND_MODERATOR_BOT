# Brand Bot

## Overview
Brand Bot is a Streamlit application that scrapes a website, extracts text from PDFs, and uses a language model to answer questions about the brand. It leverages web scraping, PDF text extraction, and a vector database (Chroma) to provide relevant answers based on the ingested data.

## Setup
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```

2. **Running the App**:
   - Start the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main.py
     ```

## Usage
- **Home Page**: Enter a website URL and/or upload PDF files. Click "Submit" to start the data ingestion process.
- **Bot Page**: Ask questions about the brand, and the bot will provide answers based on the ingested data.

## File Descriptions
- **brand_data.txt**: Contains the scraped text from the website. This file is used to chunk and embed the data for the vector database.
- **brand_links.txt**: Stores the links found during the scraping process. This file is used for debugging and tracking the scraping progress.
- **chunked_data.txt**: Contains the text chunks created from the scraped data. These chunks are used for embedding and querying the vector database.
- **visited.txt**: Records the URLs that have been visited during the scraping process. This file is used to avoid re-scraping the same URLs.
- **response_tracking.txt**: Logs the queries and responses generated by the bot. This file is used for debugging and tracking the bot's performance.

## Additional Notes
- The app uses Streamlit for the UI, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Chroma for vector storage.
- The language model is powered by Groq, and the embeddings are generated using HuggingFace's BGE model.
- The app is designed to be modular, with separate functions for scraping, PDF extraction, chunking, and querying.
